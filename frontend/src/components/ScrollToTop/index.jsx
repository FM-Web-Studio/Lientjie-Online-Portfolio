/**
 * Reset scroll position on navigation.
 *
 * Without this, clicking a nav link keeps the previous page's scroll offset -
 * so leaving a scrolled Home page drops you two-thirds of the way down Work,
 * below its heading, usually staring at loading skeletons. It reads as the
 * site being broken.
 *
 * Lenis owns the scroll position when momentum scrolling is active, so it has
 * to be told directly; `window.scrollTo` alone gets overwritten on its next
 * frame. `immediate` skips the easing - animating the reset would show the
 * visitor a fast scroll through a page they never asked to see.
